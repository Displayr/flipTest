#' Pearson's Chi-squared Test for Count Data
#'
#' \code{chisq.test} performs chi-squared contingency table tests and goodness-of-fit tests. 
#' @param x A numeric vector or matrix. x and y can also both be factors.
#' @param y	A numeric vector; ignored if x is a matrix. If x is a factor, y should be a factor of the same length.

x	


correct	
a logical indicating whether to apply continuity correction when computing the test statistic for 2 by 2 tables: one half is subtracted from all |O - E| differences; however, the correction will not be bigger than the differences themselves. No correction is done if simulate.p.value = TRUE.
p	
a vector of probabilities of the same length of x. An error is given if any entry of p is negative.
rescale.p	
a logical scalar; if TRUE then p is rescaled (if necessary) to sum to 1. If rescale.p is FALSE, and p does not sum to 1, an error is given.
simulate.p.value	
a logical indicating whether to compute p-values by Monte Carlo simulation.
B	
an integer specifying the number of replicates used in the Monte Carlo test.
